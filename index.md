I consider myself as Computer Vision and Deep Learning researcher. But, I also love to do projects that are of interest to me irrespective of its domain.  

I am a graduate student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) specialising in Robotics under the department of Electical and Computer Engineering. I am passionate and interested to work on real life problems in the field of Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Robotics.

Before joining UCSD as a Master's student, I worked at Helwett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as System/Software Engineer for an year. I was part of the security team of HPE "OneView" - Server management software. Previous to it, I also interned at HPE for 6 months. 

I got my undergraduate Bachelor's in Engineering degree from Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, India in 2018. My major was Electronics and Communication Engineering. I interned as Computer Vision researcher at VigyanLabs Pvt Ltd, India during my penultimate semester.

## My projects
### Image Captioning using Neural Networks
Developed a Deep learning model to generate textual description of given image. Used Resnet-152 based CNN model (Encoder) to extract features from training images. These features were feeded into an LSTM network (Decoder) to sequentially generate captions of images. This project was based on "Show and tell" model.

Various experiments for improving the model efficiency based on optimizers, GloVe word embeddings, LSTM hidden layer feature size , types of Decoder models (RNN, GRU, LSTM) were carried out. [Link_to_project](https://github.com/sushruthn96/Image_Captioning_ML_IP)

### Automated energy meter reading using machine learning and image processing.
Designed and developed an image processing and CNN based system which automatically detects energy meter readings. Image processing techniques including Gaussian Blur,Canny edge detection and Hough transforms were used. CNN based classification of different energy meters and LeNet based CNN model to detect digital energy meters were developed. [Link_to_project](https://github.com/sushruthn96/AMR-with-CV)

### Traffic guidance system using Computer Vision
Prototyped a system which detects the traffic signals and signs, thereon stopping, moving and varying the speed of the vehicle accordingly. CLAHE, feature ex- traction techniques and Vision API were used. [Link_to_project](https://github.com/sushruthn96/Automated_Traffic_Guidance_System)

### MNIST dataset classification using CNN
MNIST classification and prediction model was trained using various custom architectures. Maximum accuracy of around 97.2% was obtained. [Link_to_project](https://github.com/sushruthn96/Digit_classification_using_CNN)

###  PID controller for Pluto drone
Participated in a national level robotics competition named "E-yantra" conducted by IIT Bombay, India. We were given the challenge to make a quadcopter follow a land based bot and navigate smoothly to its destination. ROS was used to communicate with the quadcopter from our workstation. PID control algorithms (for stabilizing and flying the quadcopter) were developed in python.

### Biomedical feedback using Wireless sensor nodes
As part of Texas Instruments India Innovation Challenge Design Contest where around 2000 different ideas were submitted by students cutting across different colleges , we developed a wearable module based on CC3200 microcontroller which measures real-time health parameters like heart rate, temperature and blood oxygen levels of a patient which can then be sent to the doctor’s smartphone using Wireless Sensor Node (WSN) technology via a centralized database. In addition, an alert message in case of abnormal health parameters is sent to the doctor’s smartphone. This way, remote monitoring of patients can be enabled and the archaic file system can be completely made obsolete. Our prototype module made the cut into the top 30 startup ideas to be incubated by Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB) and an initial monetary funding to the tune of 3 Lakh rupees was provided by Texas Instruments for fabricating the wearable module.

### Supermarket billing software
Built a basic version of supermarket billing software using Swings,Applets and multithreading in Java to generate bills based on the items purchased. [Link_to_project]()
